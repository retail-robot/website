            <h2>Thoughts on software development</h2>
            <p>
                A question I'm asked a lot by parents is "how do I raise my kid to become a developer?"
            </p>
            <p>
                (Quickly this is followed up by an "I bet you were really good at Math". An underlying assumption being that math 
                is really important. It has been to some extent, but I was middling at Math growing up (and still am). 
                I could follow the lessons, and pass the classes well enough but I don't think they really stuck all too 
                well with me. I'm no mathematician.
            </p>

                I think most of my success as a developer came from the <em>way</em> I was taught things - be it math, or science, 
                or writing, or music. It was not the subjects in and of themselves, but the way I was taught to engage with the 
                world around me, to seek out knowledge, and how to evaluate my understanding of the world. Systems thinking and 
                critical thinking are the skills I value most about myself. The ability not just to craft a hypothesis, but to test
                it requires you to think deeply about the truth of things. How do you prove something? (You need to be able to repeat
                it). You need to be able to think critically to write and test a hypothesis.

                My literature classes taught me to think in lenses - systems of meaning. At the time it seemed arbitrary, but
                looking back it taught me a blunt framework to look at things with more than one point of view. I remember
                disliking it because it seemed silly to only apply analysis from one lens, but looking back, even that was teaching
                me the value of systems thinking - divide and conquer. Analyze things in their simplest state, and combine the 
                analysis later.

                Most good software requires the writer to model an entire domain of information. To some extent, you are discerning 
                what is important to model, what is practical to model, and where performance is a limiting factor, what you can 
                cut or elide about that model without undercutting the usefulness of a program's output.
